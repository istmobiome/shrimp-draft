    Archive containing the curated output of dada2 pipelineâ€“-ASV table, taxonomy table, sample metadata, & representative fasta sequences. Data is available as a) stand-alone text files, b) bundled in a microtable object, and c) bundled in a phyloseq object.  Archive also includes a table tracking sample read changes.

  description: |
    Detailed workflow for 16S rRNA ASV analysis using Dada2. Workflow uses paired end reads, beginning with raw fastq files, ending with sequence &  taxonomy tables. Microtable & phyloseq objects are produced to collate the data for downstream analysis.
