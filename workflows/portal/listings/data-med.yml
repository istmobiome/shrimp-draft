    Archive containing the curated output of MED pipelineâ€“-OTU table, taxonomy table, sample metadata, & representative fasta sequences. Data is available as a) stand-alone text files, b) bundled in a microtable object, and c) bundled in a phyloseq object.  Archive also includes a table tracking sample read changes.
